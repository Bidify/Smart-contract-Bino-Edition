# Smart-contract-Bino-Edition
Bidify auction contract to include buy it now feature

This Repo builds on the Haruto edition which added free bidding and adds a buy it now feature which allows sellers to set a maximum bid, which, if reached will end the Auction early. This feature will allow buyers to 'overbid' if they see fit.
